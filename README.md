# Research Objectives
The primary objective is to identify and analyze the key factors that contribute to student success
in higher education, with a particular focus on:
- Understanding the relationship between institutional characteristics and student outcomes
- Examining the role of financial investments in educational quality
- Investigating demographic factors in educational access and success

# Research Hypotheses
# H1: State-Level Education Performance
- States differ significantly in their education performance, with differences across multiple
metrics.
- **Null hypothesis:** No significant relationship exists in educational performance across
different states.
# H2: Accessibility and Success Trade-offs
- More selective institutions (lower admission rates) show better student outcomes, but at
the cost of reduced accessibility
- **Null hypothesis:** Institution selectivity does not significantly impact student success
metrics
# H3: Demographic Equity in Outcomes
- Institutions with more diverse student populations show different patterns in financial
outcomes and completion rates
- **Null hypothesis:** No significant differences exist in student outcomes across demographic
groups
